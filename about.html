            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Code. Test. Refract. (Repeat...)<br/>
            <br/>
            These daily activities for programmers are my favorite things about developing software. Like painting on a canvas, or writing a book, developing software is the process of careful planning, execution, and evaluation. My passion is in providing that level of detailed work to clients, and helping automate their business needs through computer software.<br/>
            <br/>
            My name is Austin Delamar, and I'm a java programmer, web developer, and all-around computer enthusiast.<br/>
            <br/>
            I grew up in Zeeland, Michigan (USA). In highschool, I played a lot of calculator games on my Ti-83 and TI-89. That's when I first realized I enjoyed tinkering with electronics and computers. I didn't know I could make a career out of tinkering. I graduated in 2009, and completed a few multiple Advanced Placement courses, that would give me a head start in college.<br/>
            <br/>
            In Fall of 2009, I attended Grand Valley State University, and started taking courses aligned with a Bachelor's degree in Engineering. After two semesters, I quickly changed majors into Computer Science. I liked engineering, but it just wasn't something that I knew I wanted to do forever. The courses offered for Comp Sci majors highly interested me, such as C programming, UX Design, Linux Security, CPU Architecture, and more. I loved taking the C programming class and UX Design. They were well-defining classes that shaped my thinking. I graduated in 2012 and frantically applied for jobs.<br/>
            <br/>
            Currently I work at IBM in East Lansing as a Java Application Developer. Right now I'm building microservice-like API's in Java EE with Cloudant databases. But I've also been supporting and enhancing Java EE webapps, websites, desktop and database tools, and more. I love what I do and look forward to whatever is next!<br/>
